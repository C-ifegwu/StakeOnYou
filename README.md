# StakeOnYou iOS App

A production-grade iOS application for goal setting and accountability through staking, built with SwiftUI, MVVM, and Clean Architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **Goal Management**: Create, track, and complete personal goals
- **Staking System**: Put money on the line to increase motivation
- **Group Challenges**: Collaborate with friends and family
- **Corporate Wellness**: Company-wide health and productivity programs
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and analytics
- **Privacy-First**: Built with user privacy and data protection in mind

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Clean Architecture Layers

- **Domain**: Business logic, entities, use cases, and repository protocols
- **Data**: Repository implementations, persistence, and network layer
- **Presentation**: SwiftUI views, view models, and navigation
- **Core**: Design system, utilities, and shared services

### Design Patterns

- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel for presentation layer
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: Protocol-based DI container
- **Observer Pattern**: Combine for reactive programming

## 📱 Requirements
