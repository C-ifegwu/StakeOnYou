# Goals and Staking Implementation - StakeOnYou iOS App

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of the Goals and Staking feature for the StakeOnYou iOS app. The system supports three modes: Individual, Group, and Corporate, with full staking capabilities, verification methods, and robust error handling.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation
The feature follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Use Cases, Entities, Repository Protocols
- **Data Layer**: Repository Implementations (Core Data)
- **Presentation Layer**: SwiftUI Views, ViewModels
- **Core Layer**: Utilities, Services, Configuration

### Key Components

#### 1. Domain Layer

##### Use Cases
- **`CreateGoalUseCase`**: Handles goal creation business logic
- **`StakingMathUseCase`**: Manages all staking calculations
- **`GoalVerificationUseCase`**: Handles goal verification using various methods

##### Repository Protocols
- **`GoalRepository`**: Goal CRUD operations and queries
- **`StakeRepository`**: Stake management and financial operations

#### 2. Data Layer

##### Core Data Implementations
- **`CoreDataGoalRepository`**: Full Core Data implementation of GoalRepository
- **`CoreDataStakeRepository`**: Full Core Data implementation of StakeRepository

#### 3. Presentation Layer

##### ViewModels
- **`CreateGoalViewModel`**: Manages goal creation form state and validation

##### Views
- **`CreateGoalView`**: Comprehensive goal creation UI with form validation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Goal Creation System

#### Goal Modes
- **Individual**: Personal goals with optional staking
- **Group**: Collaborative goals with shared stakes
- **Corporate**: Employer-sponsored goals with company policies

#### Goal Properties
- Title, description, category
- Start/end dates with validation
- Verification method selection
- Tags and milestones
- Stake configuration (optional)

#### Categories Supported
- Fitness & Exercise
- Learning & Education
- Career & Professional
- Health & Wellness
- Finance & Money
- Social & Relationships
- Creative & Arts
- Travel & Adventure
- Home & Family
- Spiritual & Personal
- Environmental
- Other

### 2. Staking System

#### Financial Models
- **APR Models**: Fixed, Tiered, Dynamic, Promotional
- **Accrual Methods**: Simple, Compound, Daily, Weekly, Monthly
- **Fee Structure**: Stake creation fee (5%), Withdrawal fee (2%)

#### Staking Calculations
- **Accrual**: Time-based growth with configurable compounding
- **Fees**: Automatic fee calculations on stake and withdrawal
- **Projections**: Future value calculations with confidence metrics

#### Distribution Logic
- **Success**: Principal + accrued - fees returned
- **Failure**: Configurable distribution (charity, app, winners)
- **Group Failure**: Forfeits redistributed to winning members

### 3. Verification Methods

#### Supported Methods
- **Manual**: User-provided evidence
- **Photo/Video**: Media evidence upload
- **Screen Time**: Apple FamilyControls integration
- **HealthKit**: Health data verification
- **Peer Review**: Group member voting
- **Third-Party**: External service verification

#### Verification Flow
1. Evidence collection
2. Method-specific validation
3. Result determination
4. Goal status update
5. Analytics tracking

### 4. Form Validation

#### Real-time Validation
- Title length and content validation
- Description requirements
- Date range validation
- Stake amount validation
- Form completion state

#### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Visual error indicators
- Form submission prevention
- Validation state management
